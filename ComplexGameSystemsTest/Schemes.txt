Figure out complex game system
Raycast inventory system
I want it to be a system designed for 2D, I don't want to deal with 3d support

Inventory system:
Select and drag items to rearrange them.
Parameters for how many items can be stored and if they have the same ID how many can be "stacked"
A delete/sell function for the inventory
creating functionality to add items to it will be a strech goal (a shop example or something)
